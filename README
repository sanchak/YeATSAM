Installation:
 1. Use the tcsh shell (bash shell wont work).
 2. Install the cpan perl packages from http://www.cpan.org/. (YeATSAM/SHELLSCRIPTS/cpanall.csh).
 3. Set some environment variables (SRC, BIOPERLHOME, etc). The complete list is in a file called "setup.csh" - modify this file and source it. This changes the $path variable too. 


Running the YeATSAM pipeline.
1) In order to parallelize the commands, the YeATSAM pipeline is broken into several steps. 
These are in the YeATSAM/GNM/step.*.
2) However, to enable running a single transcript you have to run:
   YeATSAM/GNM/STEPsequential.csh <tagid> <transcript.fasta> <protein.DB.fasta>
